## Ola!
I'm Lucas Pains a Software Architect and above all an enthusiast. I got my bachelor in Computer Science in 2008 but started workind with technology way before I even started college. Hence where I got my many years of experiece.

I'm brasilian by birth but I had great opportunities to live in Brisbane - Australia and now I live in Colorado - USA.  

I specialize in enterprise scale software architecture and developer mentoring.

## My kind of fun stuff
As any other geek I do spend a lot of my personal time tinkering with technology but I do other stuff too. For instance, I am:

  * Kung Fu instructor (I am a pupil of Grand Master Lopes in [Kung Fu Taisan](http://kungfutaisan.com.br/))
  * Snowboarder (The fact that Colorado is huge on skying played a big deal on the decision to accept the offer to move over)
  * Volleybal player (even played semi-professional back in Australia)
