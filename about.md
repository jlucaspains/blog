## Yo!
I'm Lucas Pains a Software Architect/Engineer and above all an enthusiast. I got my bachelor in Computer Science in 2008 but started workind with technology way before I even started college. Hence where I got my many years of experiece.

I'm brasilian by birth but I had great opportunities to live in Brisbane - Australia and now I live in Colorado - USA.  

I specialize in enterprise scale software architecture and developer mentoring.

## My kind of fun stuff
As any other geek I do spend a lot of my personal time tinkering with technology but I do other stuff too. Believe me. 

But appart from a geek, I'm:

Kung Fu instructor

Snowboarder

Volleybal player (even played semi-professional in Australia).
